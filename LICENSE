Terms
	For the purposes of this license, certain terms may be used to 
describe or simply topics. 
	"Software" and "SOFTWARE" refer to the source code for this 
project including the license applied to the source code.
	A "contributor" is one or a group that copy, modify, publish, 
use, or distribute this Software, other than original author(s).

Version
	This is version 1.0 of this license. It has not been modified or 
updated since it was created.

Usage
	Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, or distribute this 
Software, for any non-commercial purpose, and by any means contigent 
on including this same license without modifications.

Copyright
	In jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or 
authors of this Software dedicate any and all copyright interest in 
the Software to the public domain. This dedication is made for the 
benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of our heirs and 
successors. We intend this dedication to be an overt act of 
relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to 
this Software under copyright law.

Warranty and liability
	THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE SOFTWARE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED 
BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THE 
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE "AS 
IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE 
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH 
YOU. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF 
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT SHALL 
THE AUTHOR(S) AND/OR OTHER PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, 
DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, 
TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH 
THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

Liability
	IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES 
AND/OR CONVEYS THE SOFTWARE AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU 
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD 
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Interpretation of warranty and liability
	If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability 
provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their 
terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely 
approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection  
with the Software, unless a warranty or assumption of liability 
accompanies a copy of the Software in return for a fee.

Revised versions of this license
	The original author of this Software may publish revised 
versions and/or new versions of this license from time to time. Such 
new versions will be the spirit to the present version, but may 
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
	Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Software specifies that a certain numbered version of the license 
"or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version 
or of any later version published by the original author(s) of the 
Software. If the Software does not specify a version number of the
license, you may choose any version ever published by the original 
author(s) of the software.
	If the Software specifies that a proxy can decide which future 
versions of the license can be used, that proxy's public statement 
of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose 
that version for the license.
	Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any 
author(s) or copyright holder(s) as a result of your choosing to 
follow a later version.
